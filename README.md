# Cassava-leaf-disease-classification
image classification with ResNet (Kaggle after deadline)

Transfer learning

I created my own resnet.
The task was sto classify each cassava image into four disease categories or a fifth category indicating a healthy leaf. With your help, farmers may be able to quickly identify diseased plants, potentially saving their crops before they inflict irreparable damage.

I build my own resnet and my train score was 0.93.

Private score 0.6145 Public score 0.6029
